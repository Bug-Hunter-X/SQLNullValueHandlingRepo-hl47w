# SQL WHERE Clause NULL Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving NULL values and the `AND` operator in the `WHERE` clause.

The `bug.sql` file contains a query that fails to correctly handle records where the `department_id` is NULL. The `bugSolution.sql` shows the corrected query.

This is a common error, and understanding how SQL handles NULLs is crucial for writing correct and efficient queries.
